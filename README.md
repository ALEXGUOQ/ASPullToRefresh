# ASPullToRefresh

### A Class for adding "Pull-to-Refresh" functionality acorss multiple, similarly constructed UITableViewControllers

### Important Note
I am no longer supporting this repository, as iOS 5 has < 7% of the iOS market share. Also, Apple's iOS 6 native pull-to-refresh implementation nicely solves the problem that this repository solved.

The codebase will remain online and available for now. The old readme can be found in the **README_OLD.md** file.
